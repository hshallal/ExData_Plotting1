This folder contains the plots of the assignment as well as the R codes used to generate them from the source data.

For example: plot1.R is the code used to generate plot1.png file and so on.

In each case, the data was prepared first by subsetting and converting the date and time columns into date and time classes and then the plot was generated and saved as a .png file.
